# Create your open CV

### Intro

We're going to use Github Pages to create a webpage so you can host your resume online.

First, make yourself a github account. If you use your edu.au account, you get free private repositories.
**Anything you put in a public repository or github pages is open to the world.**

Your website will always be called https://[YOUR USER NAME HERE].github.io/[REPOSITORY NAME]/  For example, my resume is at https://amandamiotto.github.io/Portfolio/.


### Github pages and how they work:

Github has integrated [Jekyll themes](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme) into its system to 'render' (aka make it work like a webpage). It has css to style it, and you can either pick from the predefined styles or use github themes.

You can either use HTML or something special called Markdown to style it. You may have seen Markdown before from systems like R Studio- Github has its own version but it is very very similar. You can find Github Markdown here [https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Github will assume files that end in html should render in HTML, and pages that end in .md should be rendered with Github Markdown.


## Using this template to make your own



There's lots (and lots and lots) of much prettier templates on Github - you can search Github resume templates and see many that you can clone and alter for yourself. Hopefully this workshop helps you understand how the Github pages fit together.


## If you were going to create a Github page yourself

Create a new repository.
Settings -> Pages -> Turn on Github pages
Leave it set as main->/root for the moment. When you start making more complex pages, you may want to turn this to a branch
