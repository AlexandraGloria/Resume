First, make yourself a github account. If you use your edu.au account, you get free private repositories.
Anything you put in a public repository is open to the world.

Create a new repository.
Settings -> Pages -> Turn on Github pages
Leave it set as main->/root for the moment. When you start making more complex pages, you may want to turn this to a branch

Your website will always be called https://[YOUR USER NAME HERE].github.io/[REPOSITORY NAME]/
